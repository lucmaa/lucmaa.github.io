[Mesa](https://mesa3d.org/) is an open source implementation for OpenGL. Check [repository](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/mesa/mesa) for its source code. There are something worth to learn about this project for a graphic driver developer.

## Build
It's good choice for exploring any project's source code to start with its build script. So here is the start.

### Requisite
* Run-time dependency
    - libdrm_intel
    - libdrm_amdgpu
    - libdrm_radeon
    - libdrm_nouveau
    - libdrm
    - LLVM
    - libelf
    - valgrind
    - bison
    - flex
    - gettext

* Build-time dependency
    - libx11-xcb-dev
    - libxcb-fixes0-dev
    - libxext-dev

These dependencies include from build-time headers to run-time tools. Nevertheless most of them are optional but not necessary. You can customize them in **meson_options.txt** by modifying the **value** field of each option. With the listed above run and build time dependencies installed you can create a build directory and start to configure.

``` bash
meson build
```

You can configure a minimal dependencies mesa given that WSL is not a desktop platform as the following my configuration result:

```
Message: Configuration summary:
        
        prefix:          /usr/local
        libdir:          lib/x86_64-linux-gnu
        includedir:      include
        
        OpenGL:          yes (ES1: no ES2: no)
        
        OSMesa:          libOSMesa
        
        GLX:             Xlib-based (Gallium)
        
        EGL:             no
        GBM:             no
        EGL/Vulkan/VL platforms:   x11
        
        Vulkan drivers:  no
        
        llvm:            yes
        llvm-version:    9.0.0
        
        Gallium drivers: swrast
        Gallium st:      mesa
        HUD lmsensors:   no
        
        Shared-glapi:    yes

Build targets in project: 90
WARNING: Project specifies a minimum meson_version '>= 0.46' but uses features which were added in newer versions:
 * 0.51.0: {'dep.get_variable'}
Found ninja-1.9.0 at /usr/bin/ninja
```
As you see this configuration supports quite a few components which are essential for off-screen rendering. Once dependencies check passed fully you can begin to compile and install:

``` bash
ninja -C build && sudo ninja -C build install
```

After compilation and installed as follow:

``` bash
ls -l /usr/local/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu
total 159360
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root        10 Feb  7 17:13 libGL.so -> libGL.so.1
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root        14 Feb  7 17:13 libGL.so.1 -> libGL.so.1.5.0
-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 111044912 Feb  7 17:13 libGL.so.1.5.0
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root        14 Feb  7 17:13 libOSMesa.so -> libOSMesa.so.8
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root        18 Feb  7 17:13 libOSMesa.so.8 -> libOSMesa.so.8.0.0
-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root  51541176 Feb  7 17:13 libOSMesa.so.8.0.0
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root        13 Feb  7 17:13 libglapi.so -> libglapi.so.0
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root        17 Feb  7 17:13 libglapi.so.0 -> libglapi.so.0.0.0
-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root    337264 Feb  7 17:07 libglapi.so.0.0.0
drwxr-xr-x 1 root root       512 Feb  7 17:13 pkgconfig
```

NOTE:
- Mesa is installed in `/usr/local/lib/$(uname -p)-linux-gnu` by default. So you have to `ldconfig` so that your linker can find them.
- libsoftpipe.a will be built but not installed.
- meson build system will enable compiler's `-g` flag by default unless you are building on the release branch.
- if you have remodified the **meson_options.txt** and are about to reconfigure, you need to run:

``` bash
meson setup --wipe build
```

## Off-screen Demos
Now that mesa have been built and installed we can give a try to run an OGL application. Similarly without window system supportd on the WSL, [off-screen rendering](https://mesa3d.org/osmesa.html) is my choice. We can clone the mesa [demos](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/mesa/demos) which includes a lot of demos besides off-screen demos. 

### Requisite
We need some more libraries besides libOSMesa and libGL before you can get these off-screen demos worked. They are:
- [GLU](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/mesa/glu)
- libm

To build these demos:
``` bash
gcc osdemo.c -o osdemo -g -I/home/luc/github/demos/src/util -lGL -lGLU -lOSMesa -lm
```

The executable osdemo saves the rendered pixels as the portable pixmap format. You need to covert it to image format e.g. jpg. You may do this with `pnmtojpeg output.ppm > output.jpg`.

## OSMesa Call Graphs
### Context Initialization

--> `OSMesaCreateContextExt`
--> `OSMesaCreateContextAttribs`
--> `st_api_create_context`
--> `llvmpipe_create_context`
    --> `draw_create_with_llvm_context`
        --> `draw_create_context`
            --> `draw_llvm_create`
--> `one_time_init`
--> `_mesa_init_remap_table`
--> `map_function_spec`
--> `_glapi_add_dispatch`

### Draw

Mesa supports many features from software pipelines to hardware drivers. For example Gallium, it features with several software or hardware implementations which include the two software pipelines, softpipe and [llvmpipe](https://www.mesa3d.org/llvmpipe.html). With the different pipes enabled, will the calls walk in the different paths. 

#### Three Different Build Configuration (reference to **meson_options.txt**)
| Option | *platform* | *glx* | *dri-drivers* | *gallium-drivers* | *llvm* | *osmesa* |
|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|
| **llvmpipe** | x11 | gallium-xlib | | swrast | true  | gallium |
| **softpipe** | x11 | gallium-xlib | | swrast | false | gallium |
| **tnl**      | x11 | gallium-xlib | | swrast | true  | classic |

#### Three Different Call Paths
<div align=center>
{% asset_img PopMatrix.png "Three different call paths" %}
</div>

## Q&A
#### libGL.so is not built until glx option is enabled in **meson_options.txt**.

Only with essential build-time dependencies for X11 installed and glx option configured is libGL.so built.

#### What role do DRM, DRI and Gallium play in Mesa? 

``` meson
_libdrm_checks = [
  ['intel', with_dri_i915 or with_gallium_i915],
  ['amdgpu', with_amd_vk or with_gallium_radeonsi],
  ['radeon', (with_gallium_radeonsi or with_dri_r100 or with_dri_r200 or
              with_gallium_r300 or with_gallium_r600)],
  ['nouveau', (with_gallium_nouveau or with_dri_nouveau)],
]
```

DRI and Gallium seem to be respectively different underlying implementation in Mesa. Moreover in term of swrast and i915, you have to choose either of both as you can read the following code snippet in meson.build. In fact DRI is more complicated and staler but [Gallium](https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/gallium/) is more smaller and simpler.

``` meson
if with_dri_swrast and (with_gallium_softpipe or with_gallium_swr)
  error('Only one swrast provider can be built')
endif
if with_dri_i915 and with_gallium_i915
  error('Only one i915 provider can be built')
endif
```

#### What problems are encountered when you build mesa on the WSL?

- dri based GLX requires shared-glapi
- Gallium-xlib based GLX requires softpipe or llvmpipe
- Cannot build GLX support without X11 platform support and at least one OpenGL API

That means non-X11 platform and GLX are not enabled at once.
