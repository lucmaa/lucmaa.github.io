title: Notes for Mesa
---
[Mesa](https://mesa3d.org/) is an open source implementation for OpenGL. Check [repository](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/mesa/mesa) for its source code. There are something worth to learn about this project for a graphic driver developer.

## Build
It's good choice for exploring any project's source code to start with its build script. So here is the start.

### Questions

#### What dependencies are there when you build mesa on the WSL?

* Run-time dependency
    - libdrm_intel
    - libdrm_amdgpu
    - libdrm_radeon
    - libdrm_nouveau
    - libdrm
    - LLVM
    - libelf
    - valgrind
    - bison
    - flex

* Build-time dependency
    - wayland-scanner

#### What role do DRM, DRI and Gallium play in Mesa? 

``` meson
_libdrm_checks = [
  ['intel', with_dri_i915 or with_gallium_i915],
  ['amdgpu', with_amd_vk or with_gallium_radeonsi],
  ['radeon', (with_gallium_radeonsi or with_dri_r100 or with_dri_r200 or
              with_gallium_r300 or with_gallium_r600)],
  ['nouveau', (with_gallium_nouveau or with_dri_nouveau)],
]
```

DRI and Gallium seem to be respectively different implementation on DRM.
